For more detailed explanations please see [Top-Strongest Wikia Attack Potency/Destructive Capacity](https://topstrongest.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_Potency/Destructive_Capacity), it uses the same tiers but actually has an explanation

### Attack Potency/Destructive Capacity Terminology
This uses roughly the same terminology as the physical strength list, but the scenarios might vary slightly. Overall the explanations from [Physical Terminology](##physical-terminology) should match these closely
